    <p align="justify">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
        Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. 
        Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); 
        gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; 
        rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying 
        extent common origins and are known as football codes.</p>
    <p align="justify">There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played 
        in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the 
        codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural 
        influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside 
        the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: 
        Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to
        maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many 
        professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to 
        become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]</p>

    <h4>1.Lionel Messi(PSG & Argentina) (Total Footaball Goals: 769)</h4>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi" target="_blank">Click here</a>
    <p align="justify">The Argentine great turned 35 this June but even at his age, the veteran hasn’t lost his ability to 
        weave magic on the pitch. In his first season away from his childhood club Barcelona, Messi finished with 11 goals and 15
         assists in 34 appearances overall. The Argentine star was used down the flanks by his manager Mauricio Pochettino 
         as he wanted to use Messi’s skills with the ball on his feet. Messi didn’t disappoint, with the 15 goals he set up standing 
         witness to that. He remains one of the best football player in the world based on his achievements and his popularity with 
         the football fans.</p>
    <p align="justify">La Pulga Atómica (the Atomic Flea) has remained at the top of this list for over a decade now, 
        and at 35, he’s still going strong. In fact, sensational stats and seasons have become second nature for him. 
        Despite missing Barcelona’s first four games of the season due to injury, Messi is likely to win La Liga top scorer 
        for the seventh time in his career with 22 goals so far and three games left to play. 
        Along with those 22 goals, Messi has 20 assists in the league so far, beating his own personal record of 18 in a season and 
        totaling 42 goal contributions in 30 league games. For any player, that’s the season of a lifetime. For Lionel Messi, 
        that’s business as usual.</p>
       <h4>2. Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United & Portugal) (Total Football Goals: 815)</h4>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo" target="_blank">Click here</a>
        <p align="justify">The only player to compete with Messi over the last decade, the Ballon d’Or this year, 
            the goal-machine, the beauty, yep it’s him – Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese, 
            forward for Premier League club Manchester United, ex-Juventus and Real Madrid. 
            Currently, he is considered even better than his rival by some experts, and that’s impressive. 
            This phenomenal player is a combination of electrifying pace, imposing physic, incredibly 
            quick in feet, and one of the best finishers to the spectator’s expectation. Two seasons ago, 
            he bagged Scudetto and Serie A’s MVP prize and Nations League trophy. Ronaldo has certainly 
            secured his spot as one of the all-time greats in the history of the game with his incredible pace, 
            physical ability, and unrivaled football intelligence.</p>
         <p align="justify">His devotion to the game was never questioned, as he remains in top 
            shape even as a 37-year-old. His all-around game and incredible ability are 
            definitely the reasons why all football experts on the planet considered him a top-tier 
            player for most of his career. Once he retires, the game will certainly miss him.</p>
         <p align="justify">Amidst doubts over his future at his club, Manchester United, 
            Ronaldo remains one of the fans’ darlings. There is almost no silverware that Ronaldo has 
            failed to win over the course of his illustrious career. Having started his career as a winger, 
            the 37-year-old shifted up the pitch and is currently employed as the lone striker both by 
            his club as well as his national team Portugal. His country depends a lot on his ability 
            to take their team home from precarious situations. Ronaldo finished last season with 24 goals for 
            Manchester United and was one of the Premier League’s top goal scorers</p>
            <h4>3. Neymar (PSG &amp; Brazil) (Total Football Goals: 416)</h4>    
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgqkpnsz6/image/upload/v1667988854/neymar_nmqt7w.jpg" width="20%" height="60%"/>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar" target="_blank">Click Here</a>  
            <p align="justify">One of the best players in the world, Neymar currently plays in the Ligue 1 
                for the club Paris Saint-Germain. Neymar is the second-highest goalscorer for the country, 
                just behind Pelé with 64 goals in 103 matches. Neymar’s 72nd goal put him in the list of top 
                ten goal scorers in PSG history, his first goal against Angers. He played an important role 
                in the victory in the 20 11 South American Youth Championship and was the leading goalscorer. 
                He has pocketed many popular and prestigious awards. Although he struggled with some injuries 
                during the past couple of seasons, he managed to pick himself up and keep playing at an elite level.</p>
            <p align="justify">When in top shape, Neymar can be truly unstoppable and play on a world-class level. 
                Nevertheless, Neymar remains hungry for titles, and although he won multiple French league and cup titles, 
                he still did not get close to winning the Champions League with his current team, Paris Saint Germain. 
                the Brazilian who has seen a lot of his talents being wasted due to multiple injury issues he has had 
                to face over the course of his career. In spite of that, Neymar has remained one of the most popular 
                names in the world of football. His country depends greatly on his abilities with the ball. He is 
                not just a goal scorer but creates them as well. His dribbling skills are something that many players 
                would be proud of. Though his current situation at his club PSG is vulnerable at the moment, there can be no doubting his abilities.</p>
             <h4>4. Robert Lewandowski (Barcelona & Poland) (Total Football Goals: 564)</h4> 
            <image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgqkpnsz6/image/upload/v1667988854/0_Robert-Lewandowski-4_tua2xk.jpg" alt="football" width="20%" hight="60%"/>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewandowski" target="_blank">Click Here</a> 
            <P align="justify">The Polish professional footballer currently plays for Barcelona and is the captain of the
                 Poland national team. He is popular among fans for his positioning, technique and finishing. Considered to be
                  one of the best strikers in the world, they claimed the Polish Player of the Year a record eight times.
                   In 2022, he received IFFHS World’s Best Top Goal Scorer Award. This year, Lewandowski won the Best FIFA Men’s 
                   Player Award and the UEFA Men’s Player of the Year Award.He remains one of the most in-form players of the generation,
                    without any doubt. His incredible talent for positioning and scoring made him one of the deadliest scorers in the 
                    world and one of the most feared strikers on the planet.</P>
            <p align="justify">Lewandowski has a well-balanced set of skills when it comes to pace, strength, and 
                technical ability, which certainly earns him the spot among the all-time greats in the history of football. 
                One of the greatest-ever players to wear the Polish shirt is the new Barcelona man Robert Lewandowski. Lewandowski 
                ended his eight-year-old association with German giants Bayern Munich earlier this month, moving to Spain to 
                join Barcelona but is expected to maintain the continuity of his form this year. Lewandowski’s career in the Bundesliga 
                is decorated with 312 well-crafted goals. Standing 6 feet one inch, Lewandowski gives his teammates an aerial presence 
                inside the opposition box and is good at using both his feet.</p>
            <h4>5. Karim Benzema (Real Madrid & France) (Total Football Goals: 441)</h4>
    <image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgqkpnsz6/image/upload/v1667988856/Benzama_wkerht.jpg" alt="football" width="20%" hight="60%"/>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Benzema#:~:text=Karim%20Mostafa%20Benzema%20(born%2019,and%20the%20France%20national%20team.)" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
    <p align="justify">Karim Benzama won the Ballon d'Or Award (his first) for 2022, beating the likes of Kevin 
       De Bruyne, Mohammad Salah and Robert Lewandowski in the race. One of the main architects of Real Madrid’s 
       winning their 14th Champions League trophy was French striker Karim Benzema. Following the departure of Ronaldo, 
       a void had been created in the Real Madrid attack which the veteran striker has now successfully filled. 
       Los Blancos do not simply count on his aerial presence inside the box but also on his ball control and 
       long-range shooting. After a six-year absence from the international scene, Benzema has returned to the scene 
       for his country France and is reinventing his forgotten magic.</p>
